Transcribe ALL text from this medical document image EXACTLY as it appears.

CRITICAL:
- Transcribe ONLY what is visible - NEVER guess or invent text
- Preserve original layout (line breaks, spacing, indentation)
- Do NOT translate, correct, or improve the text
- Mark unclear text as [illegible]

For EACH document/page, you MUST provide:
1. exam_date - The date the exam was performed or report was issued (YYYY-MM-DD)
2. exam_name_raw - Document type/title (e.g., "Radiografia do Tórax", "Nota de Alta", "Carta de Envio de Registos Clínicos")
3. transcription - COMPLETE verbatim text preserving original layout

DOCUMENT TYPES:
- Medical exams: Use the exam name as written
- Clinical notes/reports: Use "Nota Clínica", "Relatório Médico", etc.
- Discharge summaries: Use "Nota de Alta"
- Administrative letters: Use descriptive name like "Carta de Envio de Registos Clínicos"
- Any other document: Use a descriptive name based on the content

QUESTIONNAIRES:
If the page contains a filled questionnaire (e.g., sleep habits questionnaire, Epworth scale):
- Create ONE exam entry per page with exam_name_raw = questionnaire title
- Transcribe ALL questions AND their answers/responses (checked boxes, written values)

IMPORTANT: You MUST create an exam entry for ANY page with readable text. Set page_has_exam_data to false ONLY if the page is completely blank or has only logos/headers with no readable content.
