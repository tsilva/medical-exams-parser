Analyze these document pages and classify whether this is a medical exam/report that should be transcribed.

Look at ALL pages and determine:
1. Is this a medical document (exam results, clinical report, questionnaire, etc.)?
2. What is the document/exam name?
3. What is the exam date (when was the exam performed)?
4. What is the facility name?
5. Who is the physician/doctor? (Look for signatures, stamps, or "Dr./Dra." mentions)
6. What department or service is this from? (Look for department headers, service names)

If ANY page contains medical exam content, the entire document should be classified as an exam.
